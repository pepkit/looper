# Sample annotation sheet

The *sample annotation sheet* is a csv file containing information about all samples in a project.
This should be regarded as static and a project's most important metadata.
**One row corresponds to one pipeline run** (if there's just one pipeline run per sample, there's 1:1 correspondence between rows and samples as well.)

A sample annotation sheet may contain any number of columns you need for your project.
You can think of these columns as *sample attributes*, and you may use these columns later in your pipelines or analysis.
For example, you could define a column called `organism` and use the resulting attribute on a sample to adjust the assembly used by a pipeline through which it's run.

## Special columns

Certain keyword columns are required or provide `looper`-specific features.
Any additional columns become attributes of your sample and will be part of the project's metadata for the samples.
Mostly, you have control over any other column names you want to add, but there are a few reserved column names:

- `sample_name` - a **unique** string<sup>1</sup> identifying each sample. This is **required** for `Sample` construction,
but it's the *only required column*.
- `organism` - a string identifying the organism ("human", "mouse", "mixed"). ***Recommended** but not required*.
- `library` - While not needed to build a `Sample`, this column is required for submission of job(s).
It specifies the source of data for the sample (e.g. ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, RRBS).
`looper` uses this information to determine which pipelines are relevant for the `Sample`.
- `data_source` - This column is used by default to specify the location of the input data file.
Usually you want your annotation sheet to specify the locations of files corresponding to each sample.
You can use this to simplify pointing to file locations with a neat string-replacement method that keeps things clean and portable.
For more details, see the [derived columns page](derived-columns.md).
Really, you just need any column specifying at least 1 data file for input. This is **required** for `looper` to submit job(s) for a `Sample`.
- `toggle` - If the value of this column is not 1, `looper` will not submit the pipeline for that sample.
This enables you to submit a subset of samples.

Here's an **example** annotation sheet:

```CSV
sample_name, library, organism, flowcell, lane, BSF_name, data_source
"albt_0h", "RRBS", "albatross", "BSFX0190", "1", "albt_0h", "bsf_sample"
"albt_1h", "RRBS", "albatross", "BSFX0190", "1", "albt_1h", "bsf_sample"
"albt_2h", "RRBS", "albatross", "BSFX0190", "1", "albt_2h", "bsf_sample"
"albt_3h", "RRBS", "albatross", "BSFX0190", "1", "albt_3h", "bsf_sample"
"frog_0h", "RRBS", "frog", "", "", "", "frog_data"
"frog_1h", "RRBS", "frog", "", "", "", "frog_data"
"frog_2h", "RRBS", "frog", "", "", "", "frog_data"
"frog_3h", "RRBS", "frog", "", "", "", "frog_data"

```

<sup>1</sup> The sample name should contain no whitespace. If it does, an error will be thrown.
Similarly, `looper` will not allow any duplicate entries under sample_name.
