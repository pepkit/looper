Pull requests or issues are welcome.

- After adding tests in `tests` for a new feature or a bug fix, please run the test suite.
- To do so, the only additional dependencies needed beyond those for the package can be installed with:

	`pip install -r requirements/requirements-test.txt`

- Once those are installed, the tests can be run with `pytest` or `python setup.py test`.
